# Exploring-Netflix-Data-SQL-Analysis-of-Streaming-Trends
In this notebook, I conduct an SQL analysis of a movie dataset to explore key trends and insights. We begin with basic queries to count the number of movies by country and identify unique directors. From there, we progress to more advanced queries that analyze movie ratings, durations, and cast members. This analysis reveals patterns in cinematic data and highlights the power of SQL in extracting valuable information from the dataset.

QUESTIONS 
1.	How many movies are there from each country?
2.	What are the unique directors in the dataset?
3.	Which movies were released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)?
4.	What are the top 10 highest-rated movies?
5.	How many movies fall under each rating category?
6.	What movies were added after January 1, 2021?
7.	Who is the director with the most movies in the dataset?
8.	Which movies feature a specific cast member (e.g., "Kappei Yamaguchi")?
9.	What movies are listed under a specific genre (e.g., "Comedy")?
10.	How many movies were added each year?
11.	What are the top 3 countries with the most movies, and what movies do they have?
12.	How have the number of movies released each year changed over the past decade?
